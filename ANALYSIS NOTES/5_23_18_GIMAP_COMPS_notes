1. Task: use same gene annotation approach and use sequence identity to verify
all of the apoptosis genes present in the genome

-Edited Google Doc called CV_manual_annotation
-Using same procedure as before: begin with tblastn search, proceed with HMMER search with known conserved
domains
and do a final confirmation with tcoffee


2. Continued on May 27th, 2018: I have finished BLAST searches for everything. Now time to confirm top domains
with HMMER search of all molecules

-Step one download all of these known molecules into a new folder on Bluewaves called "recognized_molecules"

$/data3/marine_diseases_lab/erin/HMMER_analysis/recognized_molecules

-Step two create a HMMER script that will run all the files at one time
#created script called
  -HMMER_recognized_all.sh
