# Building Script to Mine Apoptosis Genes in C. virginica and run HMMER





########### Bluewaves Script FOR SEARCHING GENOME(BASH):



# Search for C. virginica
G=C_vir_genome

# Grep all the apoptosis key words and put into a file all together
while read line;
do grep -wF "$line" C_vir_genome >> $G_apoptosis_genes.txt
done < apoptosis_genes_list_7_19.txt


LOCAL R SCRIPT (for processing)

# Isolate only the name field, count how many of each gene there are (each different LOC ID), and make into table

# repeat for C. gigas later if it seems reasonable for the story

-Doing them one at a time was extremely slow
