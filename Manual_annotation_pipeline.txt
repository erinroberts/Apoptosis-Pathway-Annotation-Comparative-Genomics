MANUAL ANNOTATION PIPELINE (March 4th, 2018) 

GOAL: Gather three lines of evidence to make decisions
	1. -Search by protein name in NCBI, select protein, narrow results to C. gigas, D. melanogaster, H. sapiens
		this can be done using the customize tab in the upper left corner. 
	2. -sequence homology to model organisms and closest relative (tBLASTn) (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PROGRAM=tblastn&PAGE_TYPE=BlastSearch, C. gigas, D. melanogaster, H. sapiens)
	3. -domain similarity: align top hit C_vir to conserved domains (TCOFFEE) (download conserved domains from NCBI conserved domains,
		copy and paste in the protein sequence from your C virginica best hit protein, compare side by side with 
		TCOFFEE, analyze results on the html file after downloading it locally) 
		-If no conserved domains listed, use reference sequence to find conserved domains with 
		https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/wrpsb.cgi,
		-AND SMART BLAST TO DOWNLOAD SEQUENCES: SMARTBLAST (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/smartblast/smartBlast.cgi), insert sequence,
		select each of top best hits from model organisms, select GenPept, select all sequences,
		send to file, FASTA format. Paste in query protein sequence from Cgig and top Cvir hit
		-TCOFFEE TO GET ALIGNMENT FILE FOR HMM (NOT 
	4. -Look for presence of critical domains identified in pfam and uniprot (look up protein on pfam and uniprot), 
		note publications about the domain
	5. -Use HMMER to align conserved domains to the C_virginica genome to find best hit based on domain architecturex
		-use hmmbuild to build a profile with the conserved domain alignments from NCBI
		-use script HMM
		-use hmmsearch against the sequence database of the CV fna transcript full genome file
	6. -Save all screenshots in the Desktop folder with correct name, make new folder for each 
	of the gene families

Criteria that is less important: Intron, exon structure (because of high polymorphism in oysters) 


ALIGNMENT OPTION 2 (since clustalw may not be the best tool, see the multiple alignment ppt in my protocols folder): TCOFFEE
6. Run Tcoffee in default mode
T-Coffee produces three different files:
sh3.dnd: guide tree used to assemble the progressive alignment.
sh3.aln: final alignment given in ClustalW format.
sh3.html: final alignment colored in function of the CORE index from red (very consistent) to blue (poorly consistent) (Figure 2).

-Understanding the output:http://www.tcoffee.org/Projects/tcs/
The top of the output provides the average conistency (0-100) for each sequence, thus indicating wether some sequences may have a less reliable alignment. A score lower than 50 should be considered poor.
-generate publication quality alignments. https://labs.mcdb.ucsb.edu/weimbs/thomas/sites/labs.mcdb.ucsb.edu.weimbs.thomas/files/docs/multiplesequencealignmenttutorial.pdf

CONSERVED DOMAIN RETRIEVAL TOOL: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/docs/cdd_how_to_domain_architecture.html
	Enter a query (either as protein sequence, set of conserved domains, or multiple queries) directly into the Conserved Domain Architecture Retrieval Tool (CDART) page
